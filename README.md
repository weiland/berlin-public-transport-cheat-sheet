# Berlin Public Transport Cheat Sheet

**[`vbb-change-positions`](https://github.com/juliuste/vbb-change-positions#vbb-change-positions) is very similar and actively maintained.**

Idea: You enter a train to go to a certain destination.

CSV Structure:

- from: Start (start station)
- to: (destination station)
- reason: where do you want to go? (venue, street, coords, other train)
- train: which train will you take? (e.g. U2, S7, M1)
- direction: train direction
- position: where to enter the train in direction of travel (front, middle, back | north, west, south, east)
- hint: (optional) extra tips matching to a certain venue etc
